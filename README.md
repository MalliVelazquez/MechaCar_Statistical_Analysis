## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The main purpose is to analyze and offer information on the production of MechaCar. Two datasets containing information related to the MechaCar's miles per gallon (MPG) and suspension coils will be used.

Bellow we can see the 6 variables of the dataset:

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Two variables showed a non-random amount of variance: The vehicle length and the ground clearance. Both of these have a very low p-value meaning they are different from zero & had a high level of significance.
